## French Sentiment Analysis

This repo contains data and code used by [Isobel Lester](https://github.com/ic-lester/) to perform sentiment analysis on two French language corpora - one translated by professional translators, and one translated by machine translation.

### Why

This work was guided by four question:

* How accurately can a machine translate emotion and the desired impact of the author compared to a human translation?
* What variations are produced between a human generated and AI generated translation? Do they alter the meaning?
* What limitations are there to AI translation software?
* Should complex human languages be reduced to numbers? How accurately can it do this?

### How

Anyone wishing to run the code themselves has two options:

* Run everything in this Google Colab notebook [![Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1tVzfWr9M0IVkT4Iw9JLbW0TFbtZB_GjR?usp=sharing) hosted by [James Baker](https://github.com/drjwbaker).
* To set up a python environment on your machine for local processing, follow the steps described at Zoë Wilkinson Saldaña, "Sentiment Analysis for Exploratory Data Analysis," *Programming Historian* 7 (2018), [https://doi.org/10.46430/phen0079](https://doi.org/10.46430/phen0079).

### Rights
